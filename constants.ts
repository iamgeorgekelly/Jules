    title: "Wide Environmental Portrait",
    prompt: "A wide, eye-level, and always perfectly straight-on shot that captures the main object as the hero, perfectly centered in the frame. The camera angle is direct, showing the object's front elevation with absolute symmetry. The composition must feel balanced, formal, and spacious, like a feature in an architectural magazine. Use a wide-angle lens (e.g., 24-35mm) to establish the scene's context and atmosphere. Lighting should be a mix of soft natural light and sophisticated artificial light to highlight the object's form. The main object must be in sharp, perfect focus, while the background has a subtle, natural depth of field.",

It **MUST** be positioned at a precise 75-degree angle from the front of the main object, capturing its profile from either the left or the right. This specific three-quarter perspective is an absolute requirement. Render a medium shot from this exact POV, ensuring the main object is in sharp focus, revealing its depth and form. The background should have a soft, natural blur.",

Frame the shot tightly on a specific, interesting detail—such as the grain of a surface, the reflection on a metallic finish, or the join between materials. Use dramatic, low-angle (grazing) light to emphasize the texture and surface details. The point of focus must be extremely sharp, capturing every fine detail with photorealistic precision. The background should be completely out of focus.",

    title: "High-Angle Medium-Close",
    prompt: "A high-angle medium-close-up shot, looking down into the main object from a three-quarter perspective. The camera should be positioned to capture the object's interior shape, rim details, and its relationship with the immediate textures of the floor and walls. The composition should be elegant and slightly dynamic, with the object filling most of the frame. Use soft, directional lighting to create gentle highlights and shadows that define the object's form and volume. The mood should be serene and luxurious, similar to a high-end spa photograph. The focus must be critically sharp on the main object, with a gentle, natural falloff in the immediate background.",
